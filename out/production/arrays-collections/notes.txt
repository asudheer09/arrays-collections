difference between interface and abstract class:

interface
we can create interface using interface keyword.
If we dont know anything about implementation and we have requirement specification then we have to go for interface.
we can achieve 100% abstraction.
we can implement multiple inheritance through interfaces.
interface contains only abstract methods and constants.

abstract class
we can create abstract class using abstract keyword.
If we know  about implementation not fully but partially then we have to go for abstract class.
we can achieve partial abstraction.
we can implement multiple inheritance through classes.
abstract class contains not only abstract methods and constants, have also concrete methods, instance blocks, static blocks and constructors.

disadvantages with arrays:
 once we create any array we cant change its size.
 arrays can only store homogenious data, but using Object array we can store heterogenious objects as well.
 there are no methods to add or remove the elements in the array.

collection framework
================
framework ( interfaces +implementation classes)

collection: If we want to represent a group of objects as a single entity is called collection.
 for example: mangos in a basket.

collection is a root interface.
it contains 3 child interfaces.
1. List
2. Set
3. Queue

interface Collection {

public void add();
public void remove(Object o);

}

interface List extends Collection{

public void add();
public void remove(Object o);
boolean isEmpty();

}

List Implementation classes: ArrayList,LinkedList,Vector,Stack.

List:
1. insertion order is preserved.
2. duplicate objects are allowed.
3. it can allow heterogenious objects.
4. it can allow null values.

1. ArrayList:
=========
1. insertion order is preserved.
2. duplicate objects are allowed.
3. it can allow heterogenious objects.
4. it can allow null values.
5. default size of the arraylist is 10.
6. Internal data structured is used by the ArrayList is dynamic array.
7. If our frequent operation is retrieval then we will use ArrayList.
8. ArrayList is introduced in the JDK 1.2 version.

dao dao= new DaoImpl()
List list = new ArrayList();

LinkedList:
1. LinkedList  is one of the implementation class of List interface.
2.insertion order is preserved.
3. duplicate objects are allowed.
4. it can allow heterogenious objects.
5. it can allow null values.
6. internal data structure used by the LinkedList is double linked list.
7.If our frequent operation is insertion or deletion then this is the best choice to use.

List list = new LinkedList();

LinkedList vs ArrayList
internal data structure  for ArrayList: Dynamic array
internal data structure  for LinkeList: double linked list
If we our frequent operation is retrieval then we use ArrayList. ( retrieval will be fast and insertion / deletion will be slow because
its implements RandomAccess interface)
If we our frequent operation is insertion or deletion then we use LinkedList. (retrieval will be slow)

Vector:
1. Vector is legacy  class (old class introduced in jdk1.0)
2. default size of Vector is 10.
3. insertion order preserved.
4. duplicate objects are allowed.
5. heterogenious objects are allowed.
6. null insertion also possible.
7. all methods in the vectors are synchronized.

synchronization:

class A{

m1()
m2()


m10;


}
100 seconds;

1. synchronized is a keyword in java.
2. we can apply synchronized keyword on methods and blocks only.
3. when we apply synchronized keyword then at a time only one thread to execute that method or block,
other threads should wait until it finishes its execution.

Example :  public synchronized void hello(){
					//logic
				}

				synchronized{

				}

Cursors:
If we want to retrieve one by one object from collection then we use cursors.
 we have two types of cursors are there:
 1.Iterator (global cursor)
 2.ListIteror (is applicable for only List implementation classes: ArrayList,LinkedList,Vector,Stack)
 Iterator :
 It has 3 methods
 1. hasNext()
 2. next()
 3. remove()
 we can retrieve objects in forward direction.

 ListIteror
  1. hasNext()
 2. next()
 3. remove()
 4. hasPrevious()
 5. previous()
 6. hasIndex()
 7. add()
 8. set()
 9. previousIndex()
  we can retrieve objects in forward  and backward direction.

 Difference between ArrayList and Vector:

 ArrayList:
 1. ArrayList is introduced in 1.2 ( so not legacy)
 2. No method is synchronized.
 3. performance is better compared to Vector.
 4. we will use Iterator ListIterator and not Enumeration to iterate the ArrayList object.

 Vector
 1. Vector is legacy class.
 2. All the methods in the vector are synchronized.
 3. performance will be less compared to ArrayList.
 4. we will use Iterator ListIterator and Enumeration to iterate the vector object.

Map
====
If we want to store the data in the form key-value pair then we go for map.
 each key-value pair is called entry.

 inteface Map{

 inteface Entry{
  Object key;
  Object value;
 }


 }

Example :dictionary
word: meaning
ambigious: confusion
(key: value)
phone book
 name : phone
 sudheer: 8667870577
 kumar : null
 suresh: null
 null : 78851451666

 --> in the map key should be unique. (no duplicate allowed for key)
 --> only one null key is allowed.
 ---> but multiple null values are allowed.

 Map is an inteface:
  HashMap
  LinkedHashMap
  TreeMap
  HashTable
 ==========
 HashMap implements Map:
 1. allows one null key but multiple null's as values.
 2. it doesnot allow duplicate keys,if duplicate found ,new value will be replaced with old value.
 3. heterogenious objects are allowed.
 4. By default when we create hashmap object internally it create 16 buckets.
 5  HashMap is introduced in 1.2 v
 6. keys always should be unique.
 7. insertion order  is not maintained.
 8, internal data structure is HashTable.

 HashTable:
 1. it is a legacy class.
 2. all methods are synchronized.
 3. performance will be low.
 4. doesnot allows null as key and null as value.

 LinkedHashMap
 1. underlying data structure is HashTable+LinkedList
 2. it is introduced  in 1.4v
 3. insertion order is preserved.

 TreeMap:
 1. internal data structure is RED-BLACK.
 2. allows only homogenious data types.
 3. insertion order is not preserved but it will sort keys based on some sorting order.
 4. for an empty TreeMap null insertion possible, after that if you add any object will cause NullPointerException.
 5. for an non empty TreeMap, if we try to add null then u will get NullPointerException.

 ConcurrentHashMap
 1. present in the java.util.concurrent.
 2. it is introduced in java 1.5
 3. it provides highlevel concurrency.
 4. default size of the ConcurrentHashMap is 16.
 5. ConcurrentHashMap provides synchronization at bucket level.


 Wrapper classes:

 wrapper classes are introduced in 1.5 v

 int        ---> Integer
 byte    ---> Byte
 short   ---> Short
 char    --> Char
 long    ---> Long
 double --->  Double
 boolean  ---> Boolean
 float  ---> Float
 char  --> Character

 "123"---> Integer.parseInt("123")--> 123

 autoboxing and auto unboxing:

 int a=123;

 autoboxing: converting primitive data type into object type:

 Integer myObj=Integer.valueOf(a); //123


  auto unboxing: converting object  type into primitive type:

 int b=myObj;


 public int compareTo(Object obj) {

Employee e = (Employee) obj;

	if(this.id>emp.id){
            return 1;
        }
	else if(this.id<emp.id){
            return -1;
        }else{
		  return 0;
		}

 }

 we have to return +ve value if object1 has come after object 2.
 we have to return -ve value if object1 has come before object2

 Comparator:
  present in the java.util package.
  it is an interface.
  It contains 2 methods
  1. compare()
  2. equals()

  When we have to go for this Comparator is:
  1. when we dont have access to Original object
  ( the given class is present in jar file or if they given a .class file).
  2. If we want to sort based on multiple properties.

final keyword:
=============
we apply final keyword for
1. variables
2. methods
3. classes

final variable:
what happens if we apply final keyword to a variable?
example : final int a=10;
if we mark the variable as final , then we cant change its value once assigned.
we get compile time error: Cannot assign a value to final variable 'a'.

final methods:
class Parent{

    public final void myMethod(){
        System.out.println("final method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent{
    public  void myMethod(){
        System.out.println("final method");
    }
}
if we apply final keyword to a method then we cant override that method in child class.

'myMethod()' cannot override 'myMethod()' in 'com.example.finalkeyword.Parent'; overridden method is final

final class:

if we add final keyword to a class then we cant extend that class.
That means we cant create child class for that class.
final class Parent{

}

class Child extends Parent{

}
will get compile time errors: Cannot inherit from final 'Parent'

Example for final classes are :
String class and all wrapper classes.
Integer
Float
Double
Character
Long
Boolean
Short
Byte

String:
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within double quotations.
Example :
"hi" ,"hello world", " ", ""

In java we create String in two ways:
1. using literal (String s="hi") ---> SCP (String constant pool) --> duplicate objects not possible
2. using new operator (String s= new String("hi")) ---> in heap memory.--> in heap memory possible

String s="hello";
String s1="hello";

String word= new String("hello");
String word1= new String("hello");

When we create a String using new operator, internally it will create two objects, one is
inside heap memory and another one in SCP, but it will always return heap memory object.

intern()---> method will get the object from SCP.

word1.intern()----> It will get an object from SCP.

String s1=new String("hello");   // 2 objects created: 1 heap : 1 SCP
String s2="hello"; // 1 object created in SCP

String s3=s1.intern();//returns string from pool, now it will be same as s2

System.out.println(s2==s3);//true because reference variables are pointing to same instance





if we want to compare two strings we always use equals() method only.

difference between == operator and equals() method
== is operator
equals() is a method
== we use to compare primitive data types and also references.
equals() method we use to compare object contents.

In java String is immutable:

immutable means, once we create an object and if we try to modify it, instead of modifying
original object it will create a new object.

String s="sudheer";

5 threads are trying to access this s, if any one modifies that s, then it will be impact on r
remaining 4 threads.



Employee e1= new Employee(1,"sudheer", 120000);
Employee e2= new Employee(1,"sudheer", 120000);

sout(e1==e2) // false
e1.equals(e2) //false (assume in Employee class equals() method is not overridden)
 If we want to compare contents of the object then we always override equals() method.
 whenever we override the equals() method then we must override the hashcode() method.

 contract:
 If two objects are equal by equal method then they must return same hashcode.

 why we need to override hashcode ?

 Whenever you are going to use your object in any hashing related data structures like HashMap and HashSet etc
 then you must override the equals() and hashCode() methods:

Set<Employee> set = new HashSet<Employee>();
set.add(e1);
set.add(e2);
sout(set.size()); //2

Set<String> set1 = new HashSet<String>();
set1.add(e1);
set1.add(e2);
sout(set1.size());//1 because in String class its already overridden equals() and hashCode() method.

StringBuffer and StringBuilder:

String p="hello";
p.concat(" world");
sout(p);// hello

p=p.concat(" world"); //
sout(p); // hello world

because of String immutability, so whenever we modify string object, internally it creates so many objects then it will
take more memory for the application, thats why they have given StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes.

StringBuffer and StringBuilder objects are mutable.

StringBuffer vs StringBuilder:
1. StringBuffer is thread safe.
2. StringBuilder is not thread safe.
3. StringBuffer performance is low.(need other threads to wait)
4. StringBuilder is more. (no need to wait other threads)
5. StringBuffer and StringBuilder objects are mutable.

Immutable classes:
Examples:

String,
Integer
Float
Double
Character
Boolean
Byte
Short
Long

we can also create our own immutable classes:
Immutable means once we crate an object , if we try to modify it wont accept.

Steps to create Immutable class:
1. declare class as final.
2. declare all variables are final
3. provide getters only.(no setters)
