Set:
1. insertion order is not preserved.
2. duplicates are not allowed.
3. null insertion is possible only once.
4. we can add heterogenious objects.

Set Implementation classes
1. HashSet
2. LinkedHashSet
3. TreeSet

HashSet:
=======
1. it is implementation class for Set interface.
2. insertion order is not preserved.
3. duplicates are not allowed.
4. null insertion is possible only once.
5. we can add heterogenious objects.
6. internal data structure is HashTable.
7. it is introduced in 1.2 version.
 Set s= new HashSet();
 use: If we dont want to duplcates allowed and dont want maintain insertion order.

 LinkedHashSet
1. it is implementation class for Set interface.
2. insertion order is  preserved.
3. duplicates are not allowed.
4. null insertion is possible only once.
5. we can add heterogenious objects.
6. internal data structure is LinkedList+HashTable.
7. it is introduced in 1.4 version.
use: If we dont want to duplcates allowed and you want maintain insertion order.

equals()  and hashCode() method

int a=10;
int b=10;
if(a==b)
   both are same

String s1="hello"; // SCP String constant pool
String s2="hello";

s1==s2 --->true

String s3= new String("hello); // in heap memory
String s4= new String("hello);

s3==s4 --> false

s1.equals(s2)
whenever we are comparing strings then we have to use equals() method.

class String extends Object{

}

In jvm there is a memory called heap , where all the objects get created in heap.
Whenever we are working with hashing data structures like HashSet,LinkedHashSet etc then it is always recomend to use
equals and hashCode methods.

contract between equals and hashCode:
If two objects are equal by equal method then  both should return same hashCode.
