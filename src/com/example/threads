Threads:
========
Multitasking:
doing multiple things at a time.
 we have two types of multitasking there:
 1. process based multi-tasking (example : opening youtube and typing in editor )
 2. thread based multi-tasking

 java supports thread based multi-tasking;

 thread: flow of an execution.
 process: it is a collection of threads

 In java we can create threads in two ways:
 1. by extending Thread class.
 2. by implementing Runnable interface

 In both scenarios we will override run() method.

 Advantages of Threads:
 =====================

 2 files

 a.txt  ---> 10 mins
 b.txt  ---> 10 mins

 total time taken to read both files will be : 20 mins (without multi-threading)


 ThreadA -->10 mins
 ThreadB -->10 mins
 total time taken to read above files will be : 10 min (with multi-threading)

1. creating thread by extending Thread class:

Example:

class MyThread extends Thread{
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i=0;i<10;i++){
            System.out.println("this is  MyThread");
        }
    }
}

2. After extending Thread class override the run() method:
3. then create an object for the thread class.
 MyThread myThread= new MyThread();
4. once object got created we have to call start() method, when we call start() method
internally thread will be created and then run() method will be invoked.
        myThread.start();
what happens if we call run() method directly?
No thread will be created and run() method will be called like a normal method.

whenever we are working with multiple threads we cant predict the order.

which one is best approach to create thread?
extending Thread class or implementing Runnable?

Multiple inheritance: extending more than one class at time.
class A extends B, C

class MyThread extends Thread{

}

if MyThread class extends Thread class then it is not allowed to extend any other
class due to multiple inheritance, but multiple inheritance does not supported by java.

if we implements Runnable interface then MyThread class can extend another class also.

class MyThread extends Abc implements Runnable {

}
